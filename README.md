- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YaminiAne.
> I am a tech enthusiast, currently in her sophomore year of graduation.
> My majors are in Electronic and Communication Enginnering.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m very inclined towards the field of DATA SCIENCE.
  * I mostly (almost) do my coding and scripting in Python using Jupyter Notebook. 
  * Like exploring data and deriving useful stuff out of it. 
  * Despite being an Electronics student, my interest in coding and technology has lead me into taking up various courses and learn Data Science, Machine Learnin and Analytics
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning required for building models for data analysis. 
I am also trying to master Data Structures and Algorithms.

- ðŸ’— Apart from technical stuff, I also paint and read books (any book suggestions from you would be highly appreciated ðŸ˜‰).
